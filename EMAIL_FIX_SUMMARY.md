# Email Verification Issue Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
The verification email wasn't being sent during initial registration ("Create & Verify") but only worked when clicking "Resend".

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The registration API (`/api/auth/register`) was making an internal HTTP request to `/api/auth/send-email-verification` to send emails. This caused:
1. **Timing issues** - HTTP requests to localhost can be unreliable
2. **Base URL problems** - The API was using hardcoded localhost URLs
3. **Unnecessary overhead** - Making HTTP requests within the same server

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**
1. **Direct Service Call**: Instead of making HTTP requests, the registration API now calls `emailService.sendVerificationCode()` directly
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Both initial registration and resend now use the same direct email service call
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error reporting

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### File: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Added import: `import { emailService } from '@/lib/emailService';`
- Replaced HTTP call with direct service call for initial registration
- Replaced HTTP call with direct service call for resend functionality
- Simplified error handling

### Before (HTTP Request):
```typescript
const emailResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/auth/send-email-verification`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email, code, name, type: 'registration' })
});
```

### After (Direct Call):
```typescript
await emailService.sendVerificationCode(email, verificationCode, userName);
```

## 🧪 **Testing**
- Created test endpoint: `/api/test/registration`
- Confirmed emails are now sent successfully during initial registration
- Both "Create & Verify" and "Resend" now work consistently

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**
1. User clicks "Create & Verify" → Email is sent immediately
2. If email doesn't arrive, user can click "Resend" → Email is sent again
3. Both actions now work reliably without delays or failures

The verification email should now arrive in your inbox immediately after clicking "Create & Verify" during registration!
