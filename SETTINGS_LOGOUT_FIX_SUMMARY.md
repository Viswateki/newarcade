# Settings Page Logout Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were getting logged out immediately when navigating to the settings page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a combination of factors:

1. **Auto-refresh on settings page load**: The settings page had a `useEffect` that automatically called `refreshUser()` when the page loaded
2. **Server-side localStorage access issue**: The `/api/auth/me` endpoint tried to call `authService.getCurrentUser()` which attempts to access `localStorage` on the server side
3. **Logout trigger**: When the API couldn't access localStorage, it returned `authenticated: false`, which triggered the logout logic in `refreshUser()`

## The Problem Flow:
1. User navigates to `/settings`
2. Settings page loads and runs `useEffect`
3. `useEffect` calls `refreshUser()` after 2 second delay
4. `refreshUser()` calls `/api/auth/me` endpoint
5. `/api/auth/me` tries to call `authService.getCurrentUser()`
6. `getCurrentUser()` fails because `localStorage` doesn't exist on server-side
7. API returns `{ success: true, authenticated: false }`
8. `refreshUser()` receives this response and triggers logout
9. User gets redirected to login page

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Disabled Auto-Refresh in Settings Page
**File**: `src/app/settings/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Remove auto-refresh on settings page load to prevent logout issues
// The refreshUser() call was causing logout because the /api/auth/me endpoint
// runs server-side and can't access localStorage, returning authenticated:false
// 
// useEffect(() => {
//   // Auto-refresh user data when settings page loads to ensure latest data
//   const timer = setTimeout(() => {
//     if (user) { // Only refresh if we have a user
//       refreshUser();
//     }
//   }, 2000);
//   
//   return () => clearTimeout(timer);
// }, [user]); // Depend on user so it runs after login
```

**Why this works**: Prevents the automatic `refreshUser()` call that was causing the logout.

### 2. Enhanced refreshUser Error Handling
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

```typescript
} else if (response.status === 501) {
  // API endpoint is disabled - this is expected, don't log out user
  console.log('⚠️ API endpoint disabled, keeping current user session');
  return;
} else {
  console.log('❌ API call failed with status:', response.status);
  // Don't clear user state on API failure - keep current user logged in
}
```

**Why this works**: Makes the `refreshUser()` function more resilient to API errors and prevents unnecessary logouts.

### 3. Removed Problematic API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts` - **REMOVED**

The `/api/auth/me` endpoint was fundamentally flawed because:
- It runs on the server-side
- Tries to access `localStorage` which doesn't exist on server
- Always returns `authenticated: false`
- Causes unwanted logouts

**Why this works**: Eliminates the source of false "unauthenticated" responses.

## Key Changes Made

### Before:
- Settings page automatically called `refreshUser()` on load
- `refreshUser()` called `/api/auth/me` which always failed server-side
- Failed API call triggered logout logic
- User got logged out when visiting settings

### After:
- Settings page no longer automatically refreshes user data
- `refreshUser()` handles API errors gracefully without logging out
- Users can navigate to settings without getting logged out
- User session remains stable across navigation

## Files Modified:
1. **`src/app/settings/page.tsx`** - Commented out auto-refresh useEffect
2. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Enhanced error handling in refreshUser()
3. **`src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`** - Removed (was causing false logout triggers)

## Technical Notes

### Why the /api/auth/me endpoint failed:
```typescript
// This runs SERVER-SIDE, not client-side
const currentUser = await authService.getCurrentUser();

// getCurrentUser() tries to access localStorage
const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('auth_user'); // ❌ FAILS - localStorage doesn't exist on server
```

### Better approach for future:
1. Use HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
2. Implement JWT tokens that can be validated server-side
3. Move all authentication validation to client-side only
4. Use proper session management that works both client and server-side

## Results
- ✅ Users can now navigate to settings without getting logged out
- ✅ Settings page loads normally and displays user data
- ✅ User sessions remain stable across all pages
- ✅ Build compiles successfully with no critical errors
- ✅ Authentication system works reliably for both login and navigation

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper server-side session validation
2. Add user data refresh mechanisms that don't cause logout
3. Consider migrating to more robust authentication system (NextAuth.js, etc.)
4. Add proper error boundaries and fallback UI for auth issues
