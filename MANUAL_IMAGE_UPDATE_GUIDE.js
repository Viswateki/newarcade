‚úÖ QUICK TEST:

üîç CURRENT STATUS:
Your tools currently use base64 imageUrl data. Replacing with these Appwrite storage URLs will show the actual uploaded logos instead of placeholders.

üí° ALTERNATIVE: You can also update these through your frontend if you build an admin interface
that uses the same API with proper authentication.
