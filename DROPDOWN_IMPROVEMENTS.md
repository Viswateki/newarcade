# User Account Dropdown Improvements

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Email Truncation**: Long emails like "tekiviswagnabramha@gmail.com" are now properly truncated
2. **Better Layout**: Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
3. **Enhanced UI**: Added user avatars with initials
4. **Responsive Design**: Better handling of different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Added tooltips for full email display on hover

## Key Improvements:

### 1. Smart Email Truncation
- Emails longer than 30 characters are intelligently truncated
- Preserves both local and domain parts when possible
- Full email shown on hover via tooltip

### 2. User Avatar
- Displays user initials in a colored circle
- Uses accent color from theme
- Fallback to first 2 characters of email if no name

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design
- Larger dropdown width (320px vs 224px)
- Better shadows and backdrop blur
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Hover effects with scaling icons

### 4. Improved Information Hierarchy
- Clear separation between user info and actions
- Descriptive text for each menu item
- Better spacing and typography

### 5. Better Interactions
- Click outside to close
- Smooth animations
- Visual feedback on hover
- Enhanced accessibility

## Usage:
The improved dropdown is now used in `NewNavigationMenu.tsx` and will display the user's information in a much more professional and readable format.
